# noise-traffic-lights
Made a noise traffic light with my kids using Arduino Nano

We started with this tutorial: https://www.diyelectronics.co.za/wiki/#Arduino/Projects/Noise_Light/Noise_light/

We changed the wiring slightly. The changes we made were: 
- Left out the buzzer. 
- Used a Arduino Nano instead of a Pro Mini. The nano already has a micro usb
- Wired 3.3v to mic and 5v to ada fruit light strip, grounded each on a seperate ground spot.

We changed the code slightly:
See code. TODO explanation
